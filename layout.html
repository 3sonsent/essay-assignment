<h1>Zen Garden layouts</h1>
<div id= ocean>
<h2>Ocean Garden</h2>
<p>The css designed <a href = "http://www.csszengarden.com/210/">ocean garden</a>  is a very simple looking designed page. The text are white against a blue background that resembles
the ocean water. Strolling down the page the blue becomes darker as if descending to the depths of the ocean. This gradient effect
is something that really made the page stand out. The text are easy to read and the page is not over crowded with unwanted elements.
Examining the CSS was also an experience in which a few things were noticed that made the page even more enjoyable. The use of z-index and 
repeating images enlightened me to designing a page as if compositing in photo shop. This is great in that I have never thought of a web
design in that sense. This page was a pleasure to examine and eye opening in terms of new ways to use images with CSS.  </p>

<div id= rose>
<h2>Dark Rose</h2>
<p><a href = "http://www.csszengarden.com/194/"> Dark rose</a> is a design that i did not particularly care for. The page was not inviting mainly 
because of the color scheme. The grey gives it a dreary feel almost evoking sleep to its viewer. The choice to use a solid grey background was not
a good one. Also the blocks of grey used for each subject only seemed to lose the information within the color. The text used in this design are
darker shades of grey which also seems to be not a good idea. The design feels as if the designer was going for a papers on a table look. I feel it
missed it's mark. The page was so bad in my opinion, that the Css layout was boring and not very engaging. The script font type used in the header is
also a bad choice because it is hard to read considering the color and the style. I feel more color and Larger or more elements would have made the page
a better design. There was nothing special about this design and special is what we look for when exploring a page.
